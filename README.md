## Python Environment

First, we have to make sure to have a Python environment for development or testing since its the recommended way to ensure the consistency when working with many different environments.

In order to create a new environment we use the following command:
```bash
python3 -m venv ./venv
```

After that, we enter the environment with the following command from the root of the repository:
```bash
# Linux / Unix
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
./venv/Scripts/activate
```

Finally, we install the recommended packages with the following command:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When we finish to work on the project, let's make sure to deactivate the environment with the following command:
```bash
deactivate
```
